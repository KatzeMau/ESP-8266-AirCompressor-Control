# ESP-8266-AirCompressor-Control

Are you also annoyed by your compressor when it makes noise in the basement?
We have something for you!
Now you can put your compressor outside and control it comfortably via the web interface.
I have installed the compressor in a wooden box, which has a bitumen roof to protect it from water.





More and about the Project is coming soon!
More Pictures are coming soon!
